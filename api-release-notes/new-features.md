Questions:
1. Easier to integrate
2. Did more stuff with CSS in Tiny 5. What are the changes?
Previously we had a lot of inline stuff. New vs. we dont inject java. If you havent put a lot of customization, you should inherit the new theme
3. API migration guide
If you are creating a dialog or have a plugin that has tinymce functionality

Thoughts:
1. Deleted
2. Deprecated

Workaround for customization for users that have cuztomized setups

3. Editor documentation - depends on how heavy the customer side customization is

Make customers aware of the refactoring and workarounds.

Driving Goals- We want them to use the UI more.

Pre sales question- We need something that can be taken to the customer - these are the new features that we did not have in Tiny 4; The new UI; What is the use for the developer?
