## Migrating from Previous Versions

The new TinyMCE 5.0 editor comes with significant changes to the previous versions. The new editor offers an easier to navigate user interface.

Our team at Tiny has worked on creating a configurable, less cumbersome editor while retaining the familiarity of the user interface from the older versions.

This chapter describes the migration process and workarounds if you are using an older version of TinyMCE. It includes tasks that you must perform before the migration can begin, and different workaround procedures for deprecated, deleted, and updated features.
